For those users new to PM Programming the following steps are advised:

  1. Follow the Getting Started section in this application note.
  2. Follow through the WELCOME programming examples in Petzold's book
  3. Look at example programs in both Petzold's book and this application
note.

The series of programs provided in the WELCOME directory are equivalent to
the C programs in the second and third chapters of  "Programming the OS/2
Presentation Manager". These programs are meant to be used in conjunction
with this book to help develop an understanding of PM programming.
